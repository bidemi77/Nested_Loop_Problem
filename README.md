### Nested Loop Problem

#### Background  

I am working on an expected value project where there are five scenarios (A - E): 

![graphic #1](https://github.com/vmsmith/Nested_Loop_Problem/blob/master/graphics/EV1.png)

Each of those five scenarios has an assumed payoff:  

[graphic #2]  

And each of those five scenarios also has a probability that it will occur:

And of course, the expected value is the sum of the probabilities times their associated payoff:

For the time being, I am mainly interested in scenarios A and E and their associated probabilities, α and ε.
